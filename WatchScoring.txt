-- KDP's Watch-Scoring Model --
external : 30 : #729f98
  case : 20
    size : 25
      -- For modern watches, 38-40mm seems to be the ideal size
      -- (for me); obviously, vintage pieces are expected to be
      -- smaller. Lug-to-lug matters here, also, of course.
    material : 20
      -- Don't particularly like the look of (yellow, rose, red)
      -- gold (too 'flashy'), but, although I prefer 'practical'
      -- metals (stainless steel, titanium) or 'modern' materials
      -- (ceramic), I don't mind the look of platinum. I don't
      -- like anything plated or coated with anything (This
      -- eliminates most white gold (usually rhodium-plated), any
      -- sort of gold plating, PVD or DLC.).
    water resistance : 10
      -- No score for vintage / dressy pieces.
    lug width : 10
      -- 20mm preferred, but 22 or 18 are also easy to find straps
      -- for; odd sizes are a hassle.
    shape : 15
    finishing : 10
    back : 10
      securing : 50
        -- Is the back 'appropriately' attached?
      pattern : 50
  crystal : 20
    front : 60
      shape : 20
      material : 40
        -- Strongly prefer sapphire for scratch resistance; I've had
        -- problems (particularly with divers) that have mineral
        -- crystal, and acrylic requires some extra carefulness
        -- (eliminating the possibility (for me) of being an
        -- everyday watch).
      legibility : 40
    back : 40
      -- Only for exhibition backs.
      material : 50
        -- I mind *much less* if a case-back crystal is mineral: My
        -- wrist isn't terribly abrasive ;~P
      appropriate : 50
        -- Does a case-back crystal make any sense? If the movement
        -- is undecorated, probably not.
  crown : 20
    operation : 25
    confidence : 30
      -- Does it feel 'solid' or is there 'crown wobble'?
    logo : 20
    screw-down : 25
      -- Only score this if it's a sporty sort of watch (i.e., 'X'
      -- otherwise).
  bezel : 20
    material : 25
    markings : 25
    operation : 50
      -- No score if it's a fixed bezel.
  pushers / buttons : 20
    -- Only score if it's a watch that has pushers / buttons.
    operation : 50
    placement : 50

internal : 30 : #283018
  dial : 20
    colours : 20
    pattern : 20
    markings : 40
      -- This includes the hour markers / those on subdials,
      -- informational text (e.g., water resistance, feature list,
      -- 'Swiss Made'), outer markings / chapter ring.
    logo : 20
  hands : 15
    shape : 60
    legibility : 40
  lume : 10
    brightness : 50
    usability : 50
      -- This is primarily focused at capturing: 'Can the watch
      -- actually be used in the dark?' (e.g., Is it possible to
      -- tell the orientation and use the complications?)
  features : 25
    -- This ought to have been labelled 'complications'. Due to
    -- technical limitations of my toolchain, give a *single*
    -- aggregate rating for all of the complications.
    <points for each> : 50
    overall usability : 50
  movement : 30
    quality : 16
      -- This includes accuracy and reliability.
    decoration : 7
      -- Probably ought to decrease the weight on this, given that
      -- haute horologie isn't really my thing ... but I *do* love
      -- a movement where someone's taken the time to finish
      -- things nicely.
    power reserve : 10
      -- I've arbitrarily chosen to take 120 hours as the
      -- 'standard' for power reserve; this score will be power
      -- reserve hours divided by 120, rounded to the nearest
      -- whole number, with a maximum of 10.
    in-house : 13
      -- Given my watch preferences, this weight is probably a bit
      -- high; I suppose it's taking a philosophical stand for
      -- tradition and for the future of watchmaking.
    ease of servicing : 7
    sweep quality : 22
    features : 13
      hacking : 40
      hand-windable : 60
        -- Only score this for automatics; not being able to wind by
        -- hand to start the movement is quite annoying.
    sound : 12

overall : 40 : #aa863a
  concept : 15
  execution : 25
  versatility : 10
    of use : 50
      -- What contexts is it usable in? Could it be worn with
      -- sandals, hiking, diving, to dinner, with a necktie
      -- (That's about as 'dressy' as I get these days ... besides
      -- wearing 'dress' watches in non-dressy contexts 0:~})
    strap options : 50
      -- Does it look good on a Nato, leather, rubber strap? ...
      -- on a mesh, metal bracelet?
  'K-factor' : 50
    -- What does the watch 'say' to me?
