-- Logo nice, calls back trident on the second hand and wave
-- of dial, although looks to me like the case-back trident
-- is a bit more rounded than the one on the second hand --
-- would be nice if they were identical (except for scale).

-- Would have preferred numerals at 2 / 4 / 6; 8 is very

-- Nicely-applied markings, like the minutes track round the

-- Can be a bit tricky to see the GMT hand when the minutes
-- hand is over it (although you can, then, infer where it
