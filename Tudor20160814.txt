-- the week (e.g., 'Wednesday' is smaller than 'Sunday') and
-- there's a slightly-strange behaviour whereby the date
-- window is partially covered during *part* of the day
-- change. Day change is nearly instantaneous. I can't
-- decide whether I'd prefer colour-matched day / date
-- discs: That was initially a criticism, but I've come to
-- like them in white; they have subtle texturing, as well,
-- which I like.
