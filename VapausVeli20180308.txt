external$case$size                       := 9
external$case$material                   := 10
-- It's 316L.
external$case$water resistance           := X
-- I couldn't find any water-resist rating; fine for a dress
-- watch.
external$case$lug width                  := 10
external$case$shape                      := 9
-- The case largely 'disappears': The highly-domed crystal
-- is the 'star of the show'.
external$case$finishing                  := 8
-- All high-polish.
external$case$back$securing              := 6
-- It's a snap-back case.
external$case$back$pattern               := 10
-- I really like the pair of winged Velimen.
external$crystal$front$shape             := 10
-- The doming on the crystal is what makes the watch work
-- for me: It recalls the high-dome acrylic crystals on
-- vintage watches.
external$crystal$front$material          := 10
-- Sapphire.
external$crystal$front$legibility        := 9
-- The crystal's doming distorts the hands far beyond
-- legibility from extreme angles; this has never been
-- a problem in practice.
external$crystal$back$material           := X
external$crystal$back$appropriate        := X
external$crown$operation                 := 6
-- The crown provides a bit too much resistance when
-- winding and moving hands; it takes a *lot* of crown
-- rotation to advance the date.
external$crown$confidence                := 10
-- No detectable wobble.
external$crown$logo                      := 10
-- The double-'V' logo matches the 'Vapaus' text on the
-- dial.

internal$dial$colours                    := 10
-- The blue sunburst appears wildly-different colours: In
-- low light, it's nearly black; in bright daylight,
-- brilliant blue.
internal$dial$pattern                    := 10
-- Not sure how to describe the pattern; under the loupe, it
-- has some sort of subtle patterning; I assume that this is
-- some sort of structure involved in the sunburst? The dial
-- appears to be slightly convex, although I cannot tell if
-- this is an illusion from the crystal.
internal$dial$markings                   := 9
-- All-printed markings; minor imperfections in printing
-- visible under magnification.
internal$dial$logo                       := 10
-- I generally prefer applied logos, but I think that that
-- wouldn't work on the Veli.
internal$hands$shape                     := 7
-- I actually find the alpha hands on some of the other
-- model (the 1950) to be *prettier*, but I bought the 2050
-- specifically for the uniqueness of the syringe hands. I
-- wish they were slightly-bevelled on the edges. A minor
-- imperfection is visible on the hour hand with the naked
-- eye; very visible under magnification.
internal$hands$legibility                := 10
internal$lume$brightness                 := 2
-- Lume is atrocious: I would have been happier with *no*
-- lume: There's not much of it, and it's not very legible.
internal$lume$usability                  := 2
internal$features$<points for each>      := 10
-- I *love* 6 o'clock dates, and the touch of
-- colour-matching the date wheel to the dial is very much
-- appreciated (n.b., because the dial is sunburst, the date
-- wheel is not *exactly* the same colour, but this doesn't
-- bother me at all.)
internal$features$overall usability      := 9
-- Wish the date were a bit larger.
internal$movement$quality                := 10
internal$movement$decoration             := X
-- I've not seen photo's of the movement specifically in the
-- Veli.
internal$movement$power reserve          := 4
-- Claimed reserve of 42 hours.
internal$movement$in-house               := 0
internal$movement$ease of servicing      := 10
internal$movement$sweep quality          := 8
internal$movement$features$hacking       := 0
internal$movement$features$hand-windable := 10
internal$movement$sound                  := 10
-- Movement sounds very nice; it somehow generates a sound
-- that I'd almost describe as a 'hum' in addition to the
-- regular ticking, which is 'clicky' but not at all
-- 'tinny'.
overall$concept                          := 10
-- A classic watch with updated materials; I *love* that
-- they did a hand-wound movement.
overall$execution                        := 7
-- Minor problem with the hour hand, lume that isn't
-- useful; otherwise a handsome watch with lovely dial
-- (and colour-matched date wheel!) and the doming on the
-- sapphire pulls things together for me.
overall$versatility$of use               := 7
-- Not suited for rough activities but perfectly nice for
-- daytime use.
overall$versatility$strap options        := 8
-- I think that it's most at-home on leather or a Milanese,
-- but I'd wear it on a Nato.
overall$'K-factor'                       := 8
