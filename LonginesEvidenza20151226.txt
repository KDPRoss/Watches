-- It's secured quite elegantly with screws at each corner.
external$case$back$pattern               := 9
-- I think it's laser engraved; the old 1889 Longines
-- winged-hourglass logo [[ The InterWebs inform me that
-- *this* is the oldest trademark still in use. ]].

-- I love the sunburst effect from the guilloche texturing.
-- (Okay, apparently, this is technically flinqu√© since it's
-- nonoverlapping.) When I wear this watch, I do get
-- hypnotised by the way that the light plays on it.
internal$dial$markings                   := 9
-- Love the interestingly-shaped Arabic numerals; the
-- printing is quite nice given that it's on
-- a dramatically-textured dial. Could do without
-- 'Automatic' beneath the logo, though, just to keep things
-- cleaner.
internal$dial$logo                       := 9
-- Nicely-applied winged-hourglass logo, although 'Longines' above
-- it is printed.

-- I *hate* the date window. It looks like someone printed
-- the full dial with a complete '6' and then just cut the
-- date window, obliterating half of the numeral (and a tiny
-- but of the subseconds dial). The window is partially
-- bevelled; the date numerals are black and in
-- a *totally-different* font to the hour markers.

-- Nice, reliable ETA 2895; wish they'd just call it that

-- forthcoming that it's an ETA.
internal$movement$decoration             := 8
-- From photo's that I've seen, the rotor is perlaged with
-- printed information; it looks like the other visible
-- portion of the movement is done in a combination of
-- perlage and snailing.

internal$movement$sound                  := 9
-- Somehow, some combination of the case shape and the

overall$concept                          := 9
-- Very classic dressy watch with an interesting shape but
-- otherwise understanted design.
overall$execution                        := 8
-- I'm still slightly ragey about the date window.
overall$versatility$of use               := 6
-- Given how many scratches mine has -- and I've not taken
-- it on 'serious' adventures -- it seems that it's best
-- suited ta 'safe' environments.
overall$versatility$strap options        := 6
-- I *do* sometimes wear it on a Nato, but I don't totally
-- think I'm pulling it off. Love it on my Milanese; looks
-- great on leather (although I don't wear it on the stock
-- strap much -- I'm *just* between two holes); I maybe
-- could see it on a muted-colour high-quality rubber strap.
overall$'K-factor'                       := 6
-- At some point, I realised that this was a 'substitute
-- buy' for the Franck Muller Casablanca.
